# vaccineslot
This was a personal project where I pulled dose availability data from the CoWIN website in India during the peak phase of COVID-19 pandemic. 

I automated the execution of the Python code as a .bat file on Windows so that it would run every 1 minute. 

This project helped me and my friends get notified as soon as new vaccination slots were released.
